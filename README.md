symstorm
========

Symfony 2 helper plugin for PHPStorm 6

Quickly navigate to your controller's action method by URL. 

Press Ctrl+Shift+K in your project, paste url into the text box and your controller class will be opened in text editor. 

It uses "php app/console router:dump-apache" to get project's routes, so php executable must be in your env path variable.
